# tmobile-hackathon-2018

This is a project to solve three of T-Mobile's problems:  
#1 Lack of parking  
#2 Conference room scheduling chaos  
#3 Collaboration space  

1. Parking (Python, OpenCV)  
With Computer Vision, we can point a camera at a garage entrance and calculate the difference between frames to draw bounding boxes around tracked cars.  This updates a count of the capacity of each garage, which can then be accessed by drivers through Alexa or text.

2. Conference rooms (AWS Lambda, Flask, Twilio)  
At T-mobile, 95% of meeting rooms are booked 2 weeks out, and 25% are no shows.  We allowed users to reserve rooms via Amazon's Alexa or text (Twilio).  Each meeting room contains an Echo, and users must check-in in the first five minutes at the room's Echo to keep the room for that hour.

3. Collaboration space (Unity3D)  
A T-Mobile office building floor is displayed in a 3D simulation which shows workspaces, conference rooms, and AI workers which all update according to a schedule and a user's input through texting or Alexa.  A short video can be found here:

For the curious, we placed in the top 5.  The winners were  
1st Place - Scan an RFID card, turn on a light remotely  
2nd Place - Business pitch about using computer vision to track cars in parking lots  
3rd Place - A video showing a plate tilting left or right to sort recycling/trash  

Really proud of our team and what we accomplished!
